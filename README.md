# Codex

Pocket Rogue is a tiny ASCII-inspired roguelike that runs entirely in the
browser and plays great on phones. Move with the on-screen D-pad, collect
crystals, and find the glowing exit to escape the dungeon.

## Play the Game

Open `index.html` in any modern desktop or mobile browser. No build step is
required.

Controls:

- ▲ ◀ ▶ ▼ — move around the dungeon
- ■ — wait in place to let monsters advance
- Tap the map — move toward the tapped tile
- **New Dungeon** — generate a fresh level at any time

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Commit and push the repository to GitHub.
2. In the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages and choose the main branch as
   the source.
3. After GitHub builds the site, visit the published URL (e.g.
   `https://<username>.github.io/codex/`) to play Pocket Rogue online.

Because the game consists of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, no extra
configuration is necessary.
