# Codex

This repository is currently a bootstrap workspace for future Codex experiments.
It only contains placeholder content, so you can tailor the setup to whatever
prototype or tutorial you want to build.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:jefmwols/codex.git
   cd codex
   ```

2. Add your project sources inside this directory. If you already have a project,
   copy or move its files here.

3. Replace the placeholder `tmp` file once you have real content; it simply keeps
   the repository non-empty.

## Suggested Next Steps

- Document the projectâ€™s purpose and architecture once you add code.
- Record any prerequisites (toolchains, SDKs, environment variables).
- Capture how to run the application, scripts, or tests.
- Add contribution guidelines and a license if you plan to collaborate.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Please include enough context in your commit messages
and PR descriptions so future readers understand the intent.

## License

Choose and document a license before sharing the project externally. Popular
choices include MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPL depending on your needs.
